1. linear graphs are bipartite by default.
2. graphs with cycles with cycle having even edges is also called bipartite graph
3. graph with odd edges in a cycle is not bipartite because it cannot have edges that match the criteria.

*. Odd-length cycles ⇒ Graph is not bipartite.
*. Even-length cycles ⇒ Graph is bipartite.
*. Can be solved using BFS or DFS.
