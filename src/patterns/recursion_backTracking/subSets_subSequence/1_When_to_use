1. when we are dealing with something that deals with permutations and combinations.
2. also dealing with sub sets meaning non-adjacent collections.
3. Example: [3,5,9] -> [3], [5], [9], [3,5], [3,9], [5,9], [3,5,9].
=> the pattern of taking some elements and removing some elements is known as subsets.
** subsets is for arrays and subsets is for strings.


Iterative appoach:
=> if we have duplicates, only add them in the newly created subsets but not on everything.
=> if there are duplicates they all should be on side to each other because if there are on different levels we cannot find if
    is already available so sort the array first.
